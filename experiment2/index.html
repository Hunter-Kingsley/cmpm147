				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This P5Js project uses a combination of randomized spawning and Perlin noise with trig functions to recreate a high-exposure image of the night sky. Circles are randomly spawned in random positions on and off screen but all within the same transformation context, which allows them to all rotate around the same point. The mountains at the bottom are created by taking Perlin noise and multiplying it by factors of sin and cos to create informed randomness. The trails left by the stars are done by not redrawing the background of every frame, just making sure the mountain is drawn over the star in each frame. Because the previous star is not being erased immediately, this gives the illusion it is leaving a trail. of </p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall I am very pleased with the output. Getting the trails to work ended up being easier than I expected and looks really good. The hardest part was getting a good-looking function for the mountain because it just required me to do a log of guess-and-checking.</p>
